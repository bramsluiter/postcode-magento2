# How to report security vulnerabilities in this Magento extension

GitHub has
a [mechanism for private disclosure of vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
to repository owners and authorized persons such as maintainers. This repository has this feature
enabled.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

See [Privately Reporting a Security Vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
Go
to [`postcodeservice/postcode-magento2`](https://github.com/postcodeservice/postcode-magento2/security)'
s [Security page](https://github.com/postcodeservice/postcode-magento2/security) and click
on [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/postcodeservice/postcode-magento2/security/advisories/new).
This will notify the owners and maintainers.

## Supported Versions

to receive support from Magento. If your Magento version is no longer supported, we strongly
recommend instructing your development team or agency to update to the most recent version.
